## üëã Software engineer and educator

Hello, I'm Ali Parandeh üëã.

I'm a Chartered Software Engineer (CEng), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Certified Developer with 9 years of engineering consulting experience across different markets. 
Currently I'm authoring a book on productising GenAI models (Building Generative AI Services with FastAPI, O'Reilly, Expected 2025) and head the engineering department of an established AI and data science consultancy based in London (Applied Data Science Partners).

I use data science and machine learning technologies to help clients make key decisions by developing data analytics and predictive solutions.

My current and past clients include: Network Rail, High Speed Train 2, Heathrow Express, Transport for London and Department for Transport.

My interests change over time but at the moment they include AI development, entrepreneurship, education and game development.

### üå± Open-source projects

I love Typescript and Python so most of my open-source projects are either in Python or Typescript frameworks.

### üßë‚Äçüè´ Workshops and Education

I'm a massive fan of tech education and have been spending a lot of time authoring content and delivering workshops to help more people getting into the AI fields. 

In 2015 I founded the Microsoft sponsored [London's Beginners Machine Learning (BML) group](https://www.meetup.com/beginners-machine-learning-london/) to help people break into Data Science & AI careers and obtain AI cloud certifications via hands-on workshops. 
Since, then the group has grown to 1200+ members. 
As an instructor of the group, I teach data science, machine learning and cloud computing technologies to other professionals/researchers and am interested in their application to impactful problems.

Additionally, I've also led 3 cohorts of [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/)' 4-months intensive software engineering bootcamps to help career switcher professional women break into tech.

You can find a list of my workshops below. Feel free to fork and adopt them for your own workshops or go through them at your own pace to learn the technologies involved.
